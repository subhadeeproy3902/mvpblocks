## Install ShadCN

### For Next Js

<Steps>

<Step>
### Create project

Run the `init` command to create a new Next.js project or to setup an existing one:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest init
```

<Callout className="mt-4">

You can use the `-d` flag for defaults i.e `new-york`, `zinc` and `yes` for the css variables.

```bash
npx shadcn@latest init -d
```

</Callout>
</Step>

<Step>
### Configure components.json

</Step>
You will be asked a few questions to configure `components.json`:

```txt showLineNumbers
Which style would you like to use? › New York
Which color would you like to use as base color? › Zinc
Do you want to use CSS variables for colors? › no / yes
```

<Step>

### That's it

</Step>

You can now start adding components to your project.

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add button
```

The command above will add the `Button` component to your project. You can then import it like this:

```tsx title="index.tsx"
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Button>Click me</Button>
